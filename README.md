## Stakeholders
Raahim V. - Tennis Player/Student Athlete:
As an athlete Raahim track his calories by using rough estimates, as of now he does not use any application.
He believes that an app that would provide healthy and delicious recipes would bring "an element of ease". His personal goals suggest he would prefer recipes of meals that are filling and that can help him sustain for a while both which can be made quickly or meals that require effort. He believes an app that provide proper nutrition plans would really help him out.

Kaysan K. - Soccer Player/Student:
Kaysan is someone who is going through his weight loss journey and for him if he ever needs to cook something he uses Youtube and Google for recipes with detailed tutorials. He would prefer an app which is "easy, convienient and specific". Kaysan believes if the app had an AI assistant that could answer his questions on the spot while he's cooking, it could really help him. Additionally, he would also like if there was a video available or if not a video, detailed recipes would be his preference. Easy, healthy and tasty recipes are his bread and butter.

Laura A. - Student:
Laura is someone who wants to begin her fitness journey. She currently has no idea on how to diet to lose weight, or how to track calories accurately. She would like an app that is able to explain this process to a fresh beginner like her. Would also like simple, easy-to-make recipes that fit into her busy schedule as she is studying abroad. She is worried about the app's ability to be used internationally, as she plans to travel a lot. Also worries about an app tracking calories when she is traveling/eating at restaurants, as it doesn't come with information about calories.

Ariel C.G. - Student:
Ariel is someone who has recently started going to the gym, and wants to put on a bit of muscle without putting on much weight. He would like an app that accurately tracks his protein, and keeps his total for each day, so he can see how hes been keeping up with his eating. Would also like an activity page to track calories lost from their workouts at the gym. Wants to have a nice variety of recipes, as he has a perception of dieting being eating the same boring meals.

## Product Vision Statement
For college students and fitness-oriented users who want to improve their diet but lack time and nutritional knowledge, dAIet is a diet-tracking and smart recipe recommendation app that provides quick meal ideas, calorie guidance, and AI-powered cooking assistance. Unlike generic recipe platforms, our app focuses on diet goals (weight loss, bulking, athletic performance) and beginner-friendly nutrition guidance.
